\begin{abstract}

This paper is a review of ORB-SLAM, a topic in seminar sensors in robots. ORB-SLAM is a feature-based monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system that operates well-performed in real-time and in environments with different illumination or scaling conditions. This paper introduces how ORB-SLAM works from the algorithm level, the primary procedure, the comparison to other popular SLAM methods, and a lesson learned from the preparation of the presentation and the paper reproduction.

\section{Introduction}
\label{section_introduction}

ORB-SLAM is a state-of-the-art visual SLAM method. As shown in figure \ref{main_structure}, the visual SLAM system consists of five modules. The camera captures images. The visual odometry (frontend) estimates camera motion based on images. The loop closure detector uses images to address the drifting problem of position estimation. The optimization step (backend) uses the information from visual odometry and loop closure detector to estimate uncertainty and eliminate accumulating drift. In the end, a map of the environment is generated according to the information from the backend.

\\

In comparison to previous SLAM methods, the ORB SLAM has the following main contributions.
\begin{itemize}


\item \textit{Features:}  ORB features allow real-time performance without GPU and provide good invariance to changes in viewpoint and illumination. Use of the same features for all tasks makes SLAM system more efficient, simple and reliable. 
\item \textit{Covisibility Graph:} Tracking and Mapping are only focused on a local covisible area. The use of covisibility graph ensures the SLAM system's real-time operation in a large environment, independent of global map size.
\item \textit{Essential Graph:} A spanning tree maintained by the system, loop closure links, and strong edges from the covisibility graph. Thanks to the essential graph, the SLAM system has a real-time loop closing operation.
\item \textit{Camera relocalization:} Thanks to significant invariance to viewpoint and illumination, the System can provide real-time recovery from tracking  failure and enhancing map reuse.
\item \textit{Map Initialization:} A new approach to select a model for the planar and nonplanar case builds an automatic and robust initialization procedure. 
\item \textit{Map point and Keyframe selection:} A reliable approach to select keyframe and map point improves tracking robustness, and ignore redundant keyframes.

\end{itemize}


\section{Technique}
\subsection{Parralel Tracking and Mapping}
Bundle adjustment (BA) is a well-known nonlinear optimization algorithm aiming at the minimization of reprojection error to provide accurate estimates of camera localization and points geometry reconstruction. However, due to the high cost of computation, the BA approach was considered unaffordable for real-time applications such as visual SLAM for a long time.

The first groundbreaking real-time SLAM using BA is parallel tracking and mapping (PTAM) by Klein and Murray in 2007. This algorithm provides effective and straightforward methods for feature matching, point triangulation, and tracking failure.  However, it is limited to small-scale operation because it has no loop closing part and low invariance to the viewpoint of relocalization. ORB-SLAM is built on the main ideas of PTAM, and have a significant improvement on the Weakness.

\subsection{Place Recognition}
According to the survey by Williams, the image-to-image matching scales generally better than map-to-map or image-to-map methods. A bag of words technique DBoW2 is used for the first time bags of binary words obtained from BRIEF descriptors to reduce the time needed for feature extraction. ORB-SLAM proposed in a bag of words place recognizer built on DBoW2with ORB, which has a tremendous speed of feature extraction and loop candidate detection.

\subsection{Keyframes and its selection}
Keyframe is an essential definition of ORB-SLAM. Many important procedures, such as triangulation of map points in local mapping and loop detection in loop closing, are based only on Keyframes. Generally, the less the Keyframes, the less the drift accumulated. However, if keyframes are too sparse, it has a high possibility of lost tracking. A reliable criterion to select keyframe is introduced in section \ref{section3}.

\subsection{Covisibility and Essential Graph}
Globally, a SLAM system can capture many keyframes. A proper way is to store these keyframes into a covisibility graph. Like its name, the covisibility graph build edge between two keyframes, when they have many covisible map points. Each edge has weight, which means how many covisible points the two keyframes have.

The essential graph is global. It simplifies the covisibility graph by subtracting edges with weights less than 100. By use of an essential graph, the loop closing can process more efficiently. The way to construct a covisibility graph and an essential graph is shown intuitively in figure \ref{covisibility_essential_graph}.
%
\begin{figure}[!htbp]%
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.148]{./images/covisibility_essential_graph}
\caption{The mechanism of how to construct a covisibility graph from keyframes and how to construct an essential graph from the covisibility graph.}
\label{covisibility_essential_graph}
\end{figure}
%

\subsection{Feature Choice}
ORB feature is one of ORB-SLAM's main contributions. As shown in table \ref{feature_extraction_time}, Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) has a tremendous advantage in computation efficiency over commonly used feature detector SIFT and SURF. The performance also meets the requirement of a real-time SLAM system.
%
\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{Feature extraction time of a single frame}
\label{feature_extraction_time}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c| } 
 \hline
 Detector & ORB & SIFT & SURF \\ 
 \hline
 Time per frame (ms)& 15.3 & 217.3 & 5228.7\\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
%

Features from Accelerated Segment Test (FAST) detector has sufficient computation efficiency. However, FAST is not invariant to rotation and scaling. Figure \ref{oriented_fast} shows the procedure from normal FAST to a scale-invariant oriented FAST. 
%
\begin{figure}[!htbp]%
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.14]{./images/Oriented_FAST}
\caption{The procedure for building Oriented FAST. The Image pyramid makes FAST scale-invariant. Intensity centroid around feature point computes orientation and makes FAST rotation-invariant}
\label{oriented_fast}
\end{figure}
%

Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features (BRIEF) is a feature descriptor, which describes the key-point with binary vector. Associated with the orientation from feature detector, BRIEF can describe key-point with orientation, which makes BRIEF to Oriented BRIEF. Figure\ref{point_correspondence} shows the matching result of 2 images using ORB.

%
\begin{figure}[!htbp]%
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.17]{./images/Point_correspondence}
\caption{Feature point matching using ORB}
\label{point_correspondence}
\end{figure}
%

In general, ORB is extremely fast to compute and match. It is feasible to match points with a large baseline because it has good invariance to viewpoint. Due to these advantages, ORB is a perfect detector and descriptor in a real-time SLAM system. 


\section{System Overview}
\label{section3}
The ORB-SLAM system, see an overview in Figure \ref{system_overview}, contains three threads that run in parallel: tracking, local mapping, and loop closing.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]%
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.22]{./images/System_overview}
\caption{ORB-SLAM system overview, showing all the steps performed by the
tracking, local mapping, and loop closing threads. The main components of the
place recognition module and the map are also shown.}
\label{system_overview}
\end{figure}

In the tracking step, the SLAM system extracts ORB features and estimates the initial pose of the camera. In addition, once tracking is lost,  the place recognition module is used to perform a global reconstruction. In this step, the system also has to decide whether the current frame is a keyframe. 

Local mapping processes the information of keyframes. It performs a local BA to have an optimal reconstruction of the surrounding of the camera locally. The unmatched ORB features are searched in the covisibility graph to triangulate new map points, which is especially meaningful in the reconstruction step.

The loop closing searches for loops with every new keyframe. Once a loop is detected, the system computes a similarity transformation to calculate the drift accumulated in the loop. Duplicated map points are fused according to the accumulated drift.


\subsection{Tracking}
Tracking thread performs with every frame from the camera. It consists of several steps.
\subsubsection{Automatic Map Initialization}
As known to all, the BA method needs proper initialization. The goal of the map initialization is to compute relative pose between two frames and triangulate an initial set of map points.

There are two models in general: Homography $\textbf{H}_{cr}$ for planar scene and fundamental matrix $\textbf{F}_{cr}$ for nonplanar scene. The system computes the score for each model M simultaneously with equation
%
\begin{equation}
S_M = \sum_i(\rho_M(d_{cr}^2(x_c^i,x_r^i,M)))+\rho_M(d_{rc}^2(x_c^i, x_r^i, M))
\end{equation}
%
Then a robust heuristc is found to compute
%
\begin{equation}
R_H = \frac{S_H}{S_H+S_F}
\end{equation}
%
The homography is selected when $R_{H}>0.45$ , which adequately captures the planar and low parallax cases. Otherwise, the fundamental matrix is selected. Once a model is selected, it is easy to triangulate initial map points. After that, a full BA is performed to refine the initial reconstruction.

Figure \ref{initialization_step} shows how the ORB-SLAM system automatically generates map points. ORB-features are extracted and marked in the left subfigure. After a proper selection of model, map points are reconstructed as in the right subfigure.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]%
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.185]{./images/initialization_step}
\caption{Automatic map initialization step of ORB-SLAM, uses fundamental matrix since it has detected enough parallax.}
\label{initialization_step}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Initial Pose Estimation}
If tracking is successful, a constant velocity motion model is used to predict the camera pose and a guided search of the map points observed in the last frame. If tracking is lost, fame must be converted into bag of words and query the recognition database for keyframe candidates for global relocalization.

\subsubsection{Track Local Map}
Once the estimated camera pose and an initial set of feature match available, it is possible to project the map into the frame to search more map correspondences. The camera pose is finally optimized with the all map points found in the frame.

\subsubsection{New Keyframe Decision}
The last step of Tracking is to decide if the current frame is selected as a new keyframe. As mentioned in section \ref{section_introduction}, the criterion of new keyframe selection is one of six main contributions of ORB-SLAM. To insert a new keyframe, the following conditions must be met.
\begin{itemize}
\item Current frame at least 50 points
\item Current frame tracks less than $90\%$ points than reference frame.
\item More than 20 frames have passed since last global relocalization
\item More than 20 frames have passed since last key frame insertion
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Local Mapping}
Local Mapping thread performs with every new keyframe $K_i$ from tracking thread.

\subsubsection{Keyframe insertion}
Once a new frame is decided as a keyframe, it should be added into the covisibility graph. 

%
\begin{figure}[!htbp]%
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{./images/covisibility_graph}
\caption{A covisibility graph of ORB-SLAM after loop closing}
\label{covisibility_graph}
\end{figure}
%
Figure \ref{covisibility_graph} shows a covisibility graph of ORB-SLAM in NewCollege dataset. After that, the bags of words' representation of the keyframe is computed, which will help triangulate new points in the data association.

\subsubsection{Recent Map Points Culling}
To ensure the reconstructed map points are trackable and not wrongly triangulated, they must fulfill these restrictive conditions.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The tracking must find the point in more than $25\%$ of the frames in which it is predicted to be visible.
\item If more than one keyframe  have passed from map point creation, it must be observed from at least three keyframes.
\end{itemize}
%
\subsubsection{New Map Points Creation}
New map points are created by triangulating ORB from connected keyframes in the covisibility graph. It is worth mentioning that the positive depth in both cameras, parallax, reprojection error, and scale consistency is checked to accept the new points.

%
\begin{figure}[!htbp]%
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{./images/local_mapping}
\caption{Local mapping step creates new map points and processes local BA in the current keyframe and connected keyframes in the covisibility graph}
\label{Local mapping}
\end{figure}
%

\subsubsection{Local Bundle Adjustment}
The local BA processes the current keyframe, all the keyframes connected to it in the covisibility graph, and all map points observed in these keyframes. Figure \ref{Local mapping} shows intuitively how the ORB-SLAM processes local mapping based on a new added keyframe.

\subsubsection{Local Keyframe Culling}
To maintain a compact reconstruction, the local mapping tries to detect redundant keyframes and delete them. A keyframe is discarded, when $90\%$ of map points have been seen in at least other three keyframes in the same or
finer scale.

Keyframe culling is an advantage over PTAM. As shown in figure \ref{KF_culling}, PTAM is always inserting keyframes, while ORB-SLAM is able to prune redundant keyframes and maintain a map with proper size. 
%
\begin{figure}[!htbp]%
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.18]{./images/PTAM_ORB_KF_CULLING}
\caption{Comparsion of PTAM and ORB-SLAM in a static environment where the camera is always looking at the same place from different viewpoints.}
\label{KF_culling}
\end{figure}
%

\subsection{Loop Closing}
The loop closing thread processes the last keyframe from local mapping threads and tries to detect and close loops.
\subsubsection{Loop Candidates Detection}
A similarity score is computed between the bag of words vector of current keyframe and all its neighbbors in the covisibility graph. The lowest similarity score $s_{min}$ is retained. According to the similarity score it is possible to find several loop candidates.
%
\begin{figure}[!htbp]%
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.19]{./images/loop_detection}
\caption{The mechanism of loop candidates detection, similarity scores is computed between current frame and its neighbors in the covisibility graph. Loop candidates is the frame with lowest similarity score.}
\label{loop_detection}
\end{figure}
%

\subsubsection{Compute the Similarity Transformation}
In monocular SLAM, there are seven DoFs in which the map can drift: three translations, three rotations, and a scale factor. To compute the accumulated drift in the loop, it is needed to transform the current keyframe into the loop keyframe with a similarity transformation. This step also serves as a geometrical validation of the loop.

\subsubsection{Loop Fusion}
After the current frame is transformed and the accumulated drift is computed, the loop fusion step fuses duplicated map points and insert new edges in the covisibility graph. All keyframes involved in the fusion will update their edges in the covisibility graph, effectively creating edges that attach the loop closure.

\subsubsection{Essential Graph Optimization}
To process the loop closing more efficiently, an essential graph optimization is used in the loop correction step. The experiment result of ORB-SLAM shows that the essential pose optimization is so accurate that an additional full BA optimization barely improves the solution. After the optimization, each map point is transformed according to the correction of one of the keyframes that observe it. Figure \ref{pose_optimization} shows an intuitive example of how to process the pose graph optimization on a small loop.

\section{Experiment}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as “3.5-inch disk drive”.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: “Wb/m2” or “webers per square meter”, not “webers/m2”.  Spell out units when they appear in text: “. . . a few henries”, not “. . . a few H”.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: “0.25”, not “.25”. Use “cm3”, not “cc”. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use “(1)”, not “Eq. (1)” or “equation (1)”, except at the beginning of a sentence: “Equation (1) is . . .”

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word “data” is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter “o”.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an “inset”, not an “insert”. The word alternatively is preferred to the word “alternately” (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word “essentially” to mean “approximately” or “effectively”.
\item In your paper title, if the words “that uses” can accurately replace the word “using”, capitalize the “u”; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones “affect” and “effect”, “complement” and “compliment”, “discreet” and “discrete”, “principal” and “principle”.
\item Do not confuse “imply” and “infer”.
\item The prefix “non” is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the “et” in the Latin abbreviation “et al.”.
\item The abbreviation “i.e.” means “that is”, and the abbreviation “e.g.” means “for example”.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named “Heading 1”, “Heading 2”, “Heading 3”, and “Heading 4” are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation “Fig. 1”, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]

\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline

\end{center}
\end{table}

      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.

      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity “Magnetization”, or “Magnetization, M”, not just “M”. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write “Magnetization (A/m)” or “Magnetization {A[m(1)]}”, not just “A/m”. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write “Temperature (K)”, not “Temperature/K.”

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
