@book{Buchli.2006,
 abstract = {The turnover prevention control algorithm of a teleoperated mobile agent was presented. For online prediction of front terrain, a low-cost terrain prediction sensor composed of a camera vision, a laser line generator, and an inclinometer was developed. The terrain parameters were obtained by finding structured laser line projected onto the front terrain and used for turnover prevention control through the quasi-static rollover analysis. As a result of turnover prevention control, the translational and rotational velocities of the agent were restricted. However, the velocity restriction for turnover prevention may bring about the inconsistencies between the intended motion and the reactive motion of the agent. Thus, the force reflection technique was proposed in order to compensate the inconsistencies. Through the position-based reflective force, the operator could intuitively recognize how the agent should be controlled to avoid turnovers. Finally, based on the experimental results, we found that the agent can even avoid turnovers in unknown sloped terrain.},
